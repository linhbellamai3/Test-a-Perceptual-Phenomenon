# Test-a-Perceptual-Phenomenon
This project was about Stroop Effect. 
In Stroop task, the participants had to say out loud the color of the ink in which the word is printed in two different condition. In the first condition congruent words, the words and the color of the ink matched with each other. However, in the second condition incongruent words, the color of the ink and the word donâ€™t match. In each case, the time it takes to name the ink colors was timed. Curious? You can follow this link to test it out:

My task is to make a data visualization for the data set and then perform statistical test (paired t-test this time) in Python.
